Basic Syntax
x = pi	Create variables and assign values with the equal sign (=).
The left side (x) is the variable name, and the right side (pi) is its value.
y = sin(-5)	Provide inputs to a function using parentheses.

Evenly Spaced Vectors
Example	Description
1:4	Create a vector from 1 to 4, spaced by 1, using the colon operator (:).
1:0.5:4	Create a vector from 1 to 4, spaced by 0.5.
linspace(1,10,5)	Create a vector with 5 elements. The values are evenly spaced from 1 to 10.
 

Matrix Creation
Example	Description
rand(2)	Create a square matrix with 2 rows and 2 columns.
zeros(2,3)	Create a rectangular matrix with 2 rows and 3 columns of 0s.
ones(2,3)	Create a rectangular matrix with 2 rows and 3 columns of 1s.
 

Array Indexing
Example	Description
A(end,2)	Access the element in the second column of the last row.
A(2,:)	Access the entire second row.
A(1:3,:)	Access all columns of the first three rows.
A(2) = 11	Change the value of the second element of an array to 11.
 

Array Operations
Example	Description
[1 2; 3 4] + 1
ans =
     2     3
     4     5	Perform array addition.
[1 1; 1 1]*[2 2; 2 2]
ans =
     4     4
     4     4	Perform matrix multiplication.
[1 1; 1 1].*[2 2; 2 2]
ans =
     2     2
     2     2	Perform element-wise multiplication.
 

Multiple Outputs
Example	Description
[xrow,xcol] = size(x)	Save the number of rows and columns in x to two different variables.
[xMax,idx] = max(x)	Calculate the maximum value of x and its corresponding index value.
 

Documentation
Example	Description
doc randi	Open the documentation page for the randi function.
 

Plots
Example	Description
plot(x,y,"ro--",LineWidth=5)	Plot a red (r) dashed (--) line with a
circle (o) marker, with a heavy line width.
hold on	Add the next line to the existing plot.
hold off	Create new axes for the next plotted line.
title("My Title")	Add a title to a plot.
xlabel("x")
ylabel("y")	Add labels to axes.
legend("a","b","c")	Add a legend to a plot.
 

Tables
Example	Description
data.HeightYards	Extract the variable HeightYards from the table data.
data.HeightMeters = data.HeightYards*0.9144	Derive a table variable from existing data.
 

Logical Indexing
Example	Description
[5 10 15] > 12	Compare the elements of a vector to the value 12.
v1(v1 > 6)	Extract all elements of v1 that are greater than 6.
x(x==999) = 1	Replace all values in x that are equal to 999 with the value 1.
 

Programming
Example	Description
if x > 0.5
    y = 3
else
    y = 4
end	If x is greater than 0.5, set y to 3.

Otherwise, set y to 4.
for c = 1:3
    disp(c)
end	The loop counter (c) progresses through the
values 1:3 (1, 2, and 3).
The loop body displays each value of c.
